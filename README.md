# CO2-emission-vs.-GDP-growth
This study examines the influence of economic growth on environmental degradation. 
This project was chosen to understand the relationship between GDP growth and CO2 (one of greenhouse gasses) emissions rate for the different countries and regions with the potential to observe the trend each country has.

We split our analyses into three different stages:

Worldwide level analysis:
At this stage we wish to analyze the general CO2 emission distribution and how it has changed globally throughout history, relationship analyses with GDP growth. Specific questions:
What's the global distribution pattern of CO2 emission? How does it change throughout history?
Is there a correlation between GDP growth rate and emission rate?

Critical time point analysis:
At this stage, we intended to investigate the critical time point that may change the global CO2 emission and socio-economic status from 1989-2020. 
Specific questions:
How does the change of economic status influence the CO2 emission pattern during the depression around 2008? 
How do countries respond to the Paris Agreement? How do countries respond to the COVID-19?
